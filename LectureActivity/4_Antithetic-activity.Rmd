# Exercise 1: Antithetic variables

Evaluate
   \[
   \int_{0}^{\infty}x^{2} e^{-x} dx
   \]
   
# Question 1:  Is Classical monte carlo valid here? With importance sampling?


# Question 2:  What are Antithetic variables used for?


# Question 3: Is Antithetic variables approach a valid approach here? 


# Question 4: Compare antithetic variable approach with simple monte-carlo. What is the reduction in variance?
